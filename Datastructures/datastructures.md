## Data Structures

---

A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. Different kinds of data structures are suited to different kinds of applications, and some are highly specialized to specific tasks. Some common data structures include:

- **Arrays**: An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. The items can be of any data type, and each item has a unique index that can be used to access it.

- **Linked lists**: A linked list is a linear collection of data elements, in which each element is a separate object. Each element (node) of a linked list contains a data field and a reference (link) to the next node in the list.

- **Stacks and queues**: A stack is a linear data structure that supports only two operations: push (insertion) and pop (deletion). A queue is a linear data structure that follows the first-in, first-out (FIFO) principle.

- **Trees**: A tree is a hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges. Each node has a value and may have one or more children. The top node is called the root, and the nodes without children are called leaf nodes.

- **Hash tables**: A hash table is a data structure that is used to store keys and values. It uses a hash function to map the keys to a specific location in the table, so that the keys can be quickly retrieved.

- **Graphs**: A graph is a data structure that consists of a finite set of vertices (nodes) and a set of edges connecting these vertices.

These are just a few examples of the many different data structures that exist. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of which one to use depends on the specific needs of the application.
